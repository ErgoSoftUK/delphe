# DelphE

## Compilation

Libraries will be compiled to the emodules:DelphE/ folder.  To ensure it exists, you must first run
`build setup`.

To compile the libraries themselves (ensure you have Mui for E installed!) and then

```
cd core
build force
```

To compile the main executable, from the main DelphE folder

```
build force
```
